# AmbientGAN-torch: Generative models from lossy measurements in pytorch #

The code in this repository, developed in Python3 and PyTorch, is designed for reproducing the results presented in the paper [AmbientGAN: Generative models from lossy measurements](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hy7fDog0b). It is adapted from [this](https://github.com/AshishBora/ambient-gan) repository, which was originally implemented in Python 2.7 and TensorFlow.

The training setup is as in the following diagram:
